<h2> Project Summary </h2>

This project contains the bash scripts and Ansible playbook that I wrote as part of my MSc dissertation.

The aim of the project was to capture and compare performance of Apache Spark Streaming and Apache Storm Trident jobs wordcount and grep. This was implemented on Google Compute Engine and University Cloud Machine. The performance metrics captured were CPU usage, Throughput and Latency.
